# anshu

anshu is a Node.js-based command-line interface for creating new projects using express js and TypeScript. It simplifies the process of setting up new projects with a predefined project structure and dependencies.

## Installation

Before using anshu, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

To install anshu globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g anshu

## Usage

Once you have My CLI Tool installed, you can use it to create a new project. Here's the basic syntax:
```bash
anshu <project-name>

express: The project type you want to create (e.g., "express" in this example).
<project-name>: The name you want to give to your new project.

## Example
To create a new Express.js project called "my-express-app," you would run:

```bash
anshu my-express-app ```

## Using npx
If you prefer not to install anshu globally, you can also use it with npx. Here's how you can create a new Express.js project called "my-express-app" using npx:

```bash
npx anshu my-express-app
